Hi friend,
I'm Nico Montali, an italian student really passionate for AI and tech. I recently got my master from Politecnico di Milano, specializing in Machine Learning. I'm currently searching and applying for a PhD position in the Reinforcement Learning field.

### What is this place

This site is intended to be a small blog regarding all my studies and experiments, hoping that it could be useful for others when in need.
