Hi friend,

I'm Nico Montali, currently a Research Fellow at Politecnico di Milano. My main research area is Reinforcement Learning.

**Update July 2019:** From September I'm going to work at [Latent Logic](https://www.latentlogic.com/).

### What is this place

This site is intended to be a small blog regarding all my studies and experiments, hoping that it could be useful for others when in need.

All my contacts are in the footer :)
