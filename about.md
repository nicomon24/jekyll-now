Hi friend,

I'm Nico Montali, currently a Research Software Engineer @ Waymo. My main research area is Reinforcement Learning.

### What is this place

This site is intended to be a small blog regarding all my studies and experiments, hoping that it could be useful for others when in need.

All my contacts are in the footer :)
