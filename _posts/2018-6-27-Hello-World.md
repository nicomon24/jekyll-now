Hi everyone, 
my name is nicomon24, and this post fix the birth of my personal blog here on github. 
I will publish some posts regarding previous projects that I made: probably, they won't get that "live" feel, but they can shed some light on what I've done in the past. While these post will try to explain everything, it is not possible to mantain the level of detail of an on-going project :)

I will also try to publish projects that I'm currently developing, updating them frequently to explain every single step.

Stay tuned!
